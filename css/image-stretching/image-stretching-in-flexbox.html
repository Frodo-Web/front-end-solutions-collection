    <h2>By default, images that are flex-children will be their <em>natural</em> height, regardless of their width:</h2>

        <p>One night towards eleven o’clock they were awakened by the noise of a horse pulling up outside their door.
            The servant opened the garret-window and parleyed for some time with a man in the street below. He came for
            the doctor, had a letter for him. Natasie came downstairs shivering and undid the bars and bolts one after
            the other. The man left his horse, and, following the servant, suddenly came in behind her. He pulled out
            from his wool cap with grey top-knots a letter wrapped up in a rag and presented it gingerly to Charles, who
            rested on his elbow on the pillow to read it. Natasie, standing near the bed, held the light. Madame in
            modesty had turned to the wall and showed only her back.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>This can be avoided by <em>not</em> specifying a width for the image, but that makes it non-responsive:</h2>
    <div data-flex>
        <img src="./Paris.jpg"
            alt style="width: auto">
        <p>This letter, sealed with a small seal in blue wax, begged Monsieur Bovary to come immediately to the farm of
            the Bertaux to set a broken leg. Now from Tostes to the Bertaux was a good eighteen miles across country by
            way of Longueville and Saint-Victor. It was a dark night; Madame Bovary junior was afraid of accidents for
            her husband. So it was decided the stable-boy should go on first; Charles would start three hours later when
            the moon rose. A boy was to be sent to meet him, and show him the way to the farm, and open the gates for
            him.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Solution 1: apply <code>align-self: center</code> to the image</h2>
    <div data-flex>
        <img src="./Paris.jpg"
            alt style="align-self: center;">
        <p>Towards four o’clock in the morning, Charles, well wrapped up in his cloak, set out for the Bertaux. Still
            sleepy from the warmth of his bed, he let himself be lulled by the quiet trot of his horse. When it stopped
            of its own accord in front of those holes surrounded with thorns that are dug on the margin of furrows,
            Charles awoke with a start, suddenly remembered the broken leg, and tried to call to mind all the fractures
            he knew. The rain had stopped, day was breaking, and on the branches of the leafless trees birds roosted
            motionless, their little feathers bristling in the cold morning wind. The flat country stretched as far as
            eye could see, and the tufts of trees round the farms at long intervals seemed like dark violet stains on
            the cast grey surface, that on the horizon faded into the gloom of the sky.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Solution 2: apply <code>align-items: center</code> to the flex container</h2>
    <div data-flex data-center>
        <img src="./Paris.jpg"
            alt>
        <p>Charles from time to time opened his eyes, his mind grew weary, and, sleep coming upon him, he soon fell into
            a doze wherein, his recent sensations blending with memories, he became conscious of a double self, at once
            student and married man, lying in his bed as but now, and crossing the operation theatre as of old. The warm
            smell of poultices mingled in his brain with the fresh odour of dew; he heard the iron rings rattling along
            the curtain-rods of the bed and saw his wife sleeping. As he passed Vassonville he came upon a boy sitting
            on the grass at the edge of a ditch.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Solution 3: Place the image inside another container, and make <em>that</em> the flex-child</h2>

    <div data-flex data-center>
        <div>
            <img src="./Paris.jpg"
                alt>
        </div>
        <p>It was a substantial-looking farm. In the stables, over the top of the open doors, one could see great
            cart-horses quietly feeding from new racks. Right along the outbuildings extended a large dunghill, from
            which manure liquid oozed, while amidst fowls and turkeys, five or six peacocks, a luxury in Chauchois
            farmyards, were foraging on the top of it. The sheepfold was long, the barn high, with walls smooth as your
            hand. Under the cart-shed were two large carts and four ploughs, with their whips, shafts and harnesses
            complete, whose fleeces of blue wool were getting soiled by the fine dust that fell from the granaries. The
            courtyard sloped upwards, planted with trees set out symmetrically, and the chattering noise of a flock of
            geese was heard near the pond.</p>
