    <p>When making this website, I wanted a simple, reasonable way to make it look good on most displays. Not counting
        any minimization techniques, the following 58 bytes worked well for me:</p>

    <pre>
      html {
        max-width: 38rem;
        padding: 2rem;
        margin: auto;
      }
      </pre>

    <p>let's break this down:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <b>max-width: <code>38rem</code></b><br>
        it appears that the default font size for most browsers is <code>16px</code>, so <code>38rem</code> is
        <code>608px</code>. supporting <code>600px</code> displays at a minimum seems reasonable.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <b>padding: <code>2rem</code></b><br>
        if the display's width goes under <code>38rem</code>, then this padding keeps things looking pretty good until
        around <code>256px</code>. while this may seem optional, it actually hits two birds with one stone - the padding
        also provides sorely-needed top and bottom whitespace.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <b>margin: <code>auto</code></b><br>
        this is really all that is needed to center the page, because main is a block element under semantic html5.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <b>a key insight:</b> it took me a surprising number of iterations to arrive at this point. perhaps that speaks
        to the fact that i know nothing about "modern" web development, or, as i'm more inclined to believe, just how
        hard it is to keep it simple in a world of complication
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <b>update 1:</b> following some discussion, I've since changed the padding to <code>1.5rem</code> for a happier
        compromise between mobile and desktop displays.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <b>update 2:</b> the ch unit was brought to my attention, and I quite like it! I've since changed to
        <code>70ch/2ch</code>, which looks nearly the same with 2 less bytes, except that the padding is a little bit
        smaller (a good thing for mobile).

    </blockquote>

    <h2>100 Bytes of CSS to Look Great Everywhere (enhanced version)</h2>

    <pre>
      html {
        max-width: 70ch;
        padding: 3em 1em;
        margin: auto;
        line-height: 1.75;
        font-size: 1.25em;
      }
      </pre>

    <p>This should be simple drop-in css to look good on most displays.</p>

    <p>Let's break this down. I've adapted the original text with my own commentary.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <b>max-width:</b> <code>70ch</code><br>
        the "readable range" is usually 60-80 character widths, and CSS lets you express that directly with the
        <code>ch</code> unit.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <b>padding:</b> <code>3em 1em</code><br>
        If the display's width goes under the max-width set above, then this padding prevents edge-to-edge text on
        mobile. We use <code>3em</code> to provide top/bottom whitespace.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <b>margin:</b> <code>auto</code><br>
        This is really all that is needed to center the page - applied on html, because Dan's site doesnt have a
        semantic tag and is more likely to exist in most sites. That the top tag centers itself relative to nothing is
        unintuitive, but thats how browsers do.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <b>line-height:</b> <code>1.75</code><br>
        Spacing between the lines to help increase visual clarity. Always leave line height unitless because reasons.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <b>font-size:</b> <code>1.5em</code><br>
        I've noticed that recent design trends and screen sizes have tended toward bigger font sizes. Or maybe I'm
        getting old. Prefer <code>em</code> or <code>rem</code> over px if you want to let users scale it.
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        You can use <code>:root</code> instead of <code>html</code> to guarantee that there is some selector present,
        but its a touch too fancy for me and uses an extra character :)
